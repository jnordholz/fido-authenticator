### Setup

For attestation to work, the authenticator's state needs to be provisioned with a batch
attestation key and certificate. They are expected in files `/fido/sec/00` and `/fido/x5c/00`,
respectively.

In the context of the SoloKeys Solo 2, "secure" devices are pre-provisioned; for "unlocked" devices,
if the firmware contains the provisioner app, this can be done with the CLI:

```sh
solo2 pki dev fido batch.key batch.cert
solo2 app provision store-fido-batch-key batch.key
solo2 app provision store-fido-batch-cert batch.cert
```
